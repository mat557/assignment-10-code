          I am mahfuz anam tasnim .I will complete my graduation within one year
          in mathmatics . There was a subject in my course that introduced me to
          programming. When i completed the course i got a message that
          programming is not much hard as is thought before . After doing some
          reaserch i was thinking to build my career on programming. My initial
          goal was to be a software developer For this reason i was searching in
          how to be a developer but there was no such guidence that will lead me
          to my future dream. Finally i found out this programming hero team as
          a rescue.THis team is helping me since beginning of the journey. I am
          investing 6/7 hour a day . I wish i acan be a good developer with the
          help of p-hero team. After 4/5 months i am thinking of taking
          internship from a renouned company.If i get this ,it will help me to
          much to find a full time job in large company. Now all i am focusing
          on programming as i know everyone looking for the skill.
